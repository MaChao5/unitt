=== Home View Controller ===

The Home View Controller class is meant to give you a scrollable, rotatable view of a large icon grid to open subviews. This is typically placed inside a navigation view controller. It is very customizable and provides a toolbar, if so desired. You can specify an image, label, and UIViewController individually for each item (our example above uses the same image for all items). For more information, see [UIWidgets-HVC Using the Home View Controller].

=== Glossy Button ===

The Glossy Button gives you two different appearances. A simple glossy button and a gel glossy button. For more information, see [UIWidgets-GB Using the Glossy Button].

=== Gradient View ===

The Gradient View gives a simple vertical gradient as a background for your view. The start and end colors and alpha values are customizable. For more information, see [UIWidgets-GV Using the Gradient View].
